## Active directory search tool built with powershell and windows forms. 

Tool can query the local AD for user and group information, searching based on several criteria. The output is written with useful fields to the form.

The tool is currently quite slow, which I believe is due to the delay in writing the info back to the windows form. I Haven't worked out a fix for this yet, other than re-writting in C#
